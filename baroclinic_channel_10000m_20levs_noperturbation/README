Generating a grid with initial conditions, based on the baroclinic channel configuration.
Using the grid file from baroclinic channel with 10 km resolution.

****** NOTE: Since I am using a grid file as stated above, I don't need to run steps 2,3,4 in the script.

Only need to run step 5, i.e. generate new initial conditions on an existing, valid mpas-o grid.
These initial conditions are generated by mpas in init mode.
